# Label

With `MDX`, we can define a story for `Label` right in the middle of our Markdown documentation.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Main">
    <div>
      <Heading>Lorem IpZCfs dfg dfg d</Heading>
      <Heading as="h2">Lorem IpZCfs dfg dfg d</Heading>
      <Heading as="h3">Lorem afjkasdfsdf</Heading>
      <Heading as="h4">Lorem afjkasdfsdf</Heading>
      <Heading as="h5">Lorem afjkasdfsdf</Heading>
      <Heading as="h6">Lorem afjkasdfsdf</Heading>
      <Text size="1">
        This is a Paragraph size 1. A really long paragraph of text, to
        demonstrate prose text, like for example, the kind you might read in a
        blog post. The reason we're using prose here is because the most common
        use case for this container size is longform text. So we're previewing
        some longform text here so we can make sure the container width provides
        an optimal line length for this font size
      </Text>
      <Text size="2">
